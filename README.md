# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your system:

- git
- docker
- docker compose

## Instructions

### Development

First install the required libraries. If `npm install` does not work, use
`npm run fix-install`. After that you can run the app with `npm start`. It
is best to add this configuration to your IDE.

Make sure the working directory is set to the repo's directory.

### Deployment

Run `./setup_docker.sh` script.
